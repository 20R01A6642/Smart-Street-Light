REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURE:

The implementation of the code for IoT-based smart street lights requires both hardware and software components. The following are the requirements for both:

Hardware requirements:
- Arduino board (such as Arduino Uno or Arduino Mega)
- ESP8266 Wi-Fi module or any other Wi-Fi module that supports the MQTT protocol
- Light sensor (such as LDR)
- Relay module
- PIR sensor (for motion detection)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- Power supply (9V battery or USB cable)

Software requirements:
- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for writing and uploading the code to the Arduino board
- MQTT broker software (such as Mosquitto or HiveMQ)
- MQTT client library (such as PubSubClient) for communicating with the MQTT broker
- Libraries for the sensors used in the project (such as Adafruit_Sensor, Adafruit_TSL2561, and Adafruit_MQTT)

IMPLEMENTATION:

The code implementation requires the following steps:
1. Connect the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module to the Arduino board using jumper wires and configure it to connect to your Wi-Fi network.
2. Connect the light sensor and PIR sensor to the Arduino board using jumper wires.
3. Install the necessary libraries for the sensors and MQTT client in the Arduino IDE.
4. Write the code for the Arduino board that reads the sensor data, sends it to the MQTT broker, and receives commands from the MQTT broker to control the relay module.
5. Upload the code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
6. Install and configure the MQTT broker software on a server or cloud-based platform.
7. Test the smart street light system by subscribing to the MQTT topics and sending commands to turn the lights on or off and adjust the brightness.

Note that the above requirements and steps are general guidelines, and the specific hardware and software components required may vary depending on the specific implementation and use case.
