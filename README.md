# Smart-Street-Light
This project is about IoT (Internet of Things) based smart street lights. They are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more efficient and cost-effective way of managing street lighting. With the use of sensors and wireless communication, smart street lights can be remotely controlled and monitored.
